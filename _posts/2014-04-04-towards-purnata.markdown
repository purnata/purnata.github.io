##### A Vision Unfolding

You might be wondering why another NGO to add to the 330 million NGOs we have in India. It was a concern for me too.

As there are so many risks and uncertainties, I tried wriggling out of it. I argued I have no funding, no backing and so on. I was sometimes afraid if I’m not putting my family at risk and if I was not being foolish. But the burden within me grew stronger, the vision got clearer and the dream just got bigger. I couldn’t shake it off as much as I tried. I became restless. I think of the survivors of human-trafficking I know would otherwise be living a daily hell if someone hadn’t given them hope, given them the good news. And yet I see so much more needs to be done, so much more to bring deliverance and transformation. This vision began to consume me. I came to a point where I had to give in.

##### Tiny Steps of Faith

As a step of faith I have begun taking tiny but sure steps that would lead to starting a new NGO in the Anti-Human Trafficking (AHT) sector. And yet the NGO is being set up to dream beyond just AHT. I have been literally dreaming, reading, reflecting, listening and doing everything possible to document the unfolding vision. There are gaps in this sector and that without addressing these gaps, Human Trafficking will only grow bigger. So, in spite of not having any money or any backing from any organisation, I am taking a step of faith into the unknown.

At the moment I am identifying staff in the three cities (Mumbai, Delhi & Kolkata) and I have found two. I have been having Skype calls with various friends & well-wishers including the staff joining me from June/July. This has helped in getting the needed extra hands to support me. A couple of weeks back I organised a three day retreat to continue work on the shared vision. One of those days was left open for a few friends and well-wishers (about 12 of us) who could make it in the midst of Holi to help deliberate with me, to crystallise a vision and mission statement, apart from fine-tuning the objectives, etc. Though we did not have enough time to do the crystallisation, we did do a lot of brainstorming which yielded good ideas and suggestions apart from prayer and support.
