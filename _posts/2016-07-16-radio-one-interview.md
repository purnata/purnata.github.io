##### Radio One Interview

Richa Chadda, a Bollywood star is helping us to raise funds through her campaign "A Bungalow on the Hill". The campaign would help Purnata to lease a building in the western suburbs of Mumbai to rehabilitate survivors of human trafficking.

As a support to this campaign, Radio One featured Aaboo Varghese - Founder & Executive Director of Purnata in the morning show "Good Morning Mumbai" with Hrishi K. Listen to the recorded version of the show in the video included below.

In the interview, Aaboo shares about the work of Purnata, some of our experiences on the ground, information on some source areas, stories of girls who have found hope and regarding paradigm shifts required to rehabilitate these survivors. We had a gud time sharing the Purnata story and about trafficking on FM Radio One. So thankful for such opportunities to get visibility and even share our stories.

The campaign hosted by our partner Ketto, Asia's most visited crowdfunding site, has presently reached almost 5.5 lakhs of the 12 lakhs targeted from 77 backers. The campaign ends on 31st July, 2016.
