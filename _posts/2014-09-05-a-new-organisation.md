##### First Steps

It has been six months since our last communication. A lot has happened since then.

Purnata has been registered as a Society under The Indian Societies Registration Act of 1860. Our board met for the first time on 18th of July, 2014. We have completed the legal formalities and received PAN Card.

Purnata has got staff in Delhi and Kolkata now. We have sought and obtained permissions to start research in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. The data collection from different agencies for research has already begun. Totally, we have covered over 600 cases in Mumbai and another 100 each in Delhi & Kolkata. We also have established contacts in the local Anti-Human Trafficking networks in all the three cities.

We have been conducting awareness programs to large to medium sized groups. So far, we have met over hundreds of individuals and 75 civil and government agencies across the three cities. 

Purnata is partnering with other organizations for different programs and activities. We also have a good team of volunteers giving us their time and efforts ranging from one to four months. Many individuals have expressed interest in involving part-time towards various aspects of our work.

We had a quite a lot of expenses - both establishment and operational. We now have a few people supporting Purnata either through monthly commitments, or as generous donations.
