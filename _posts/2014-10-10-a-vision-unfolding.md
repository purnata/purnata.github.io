##### A Vision Unfolding

Several people have asked me in the last few months what made me leave a safer and comfortable job to pursue what seems to be risky, less secure and less comfortable path. I have always answered them that what has given me boldness to take that step of faith is calling and vision from God.

Where are you headed to in life? What is your destiny? Where will you be in five years? Or ten, or twenty? No matter how much we plan or work towards it, no one can answer that question with certainty. But while we can't know our destiny, we CAN know and change our direction on this journey.

The journey toward our destiny always begins with vision. Vision gives us direction; it is the roadmap to your destiny. Vision in short is the picture of your purpose.

How can you start discovering your vision today?

Take some time to EXPLORE and ask yourself:

- What is your passion?
- How have past lessons and experiences prepared you to pursue your passion?
- What is happening in the same sector/area (look for trends)?
- What do you want to accomplish in your life?
- What is God's part in your life and dream?
- What are the resources available to you?
- Who can partner with you in this pursuit?

With the latest update on the Global Slavery Index for 2014, we have a mind boggling 35.8 million slaves in the world today of which almost half are in India with 14.3 million, making India the Hub for human trafficking & slavery.

What is your vision? Whats your direction in life? Do you see the need to do something related to the issues of injustice? Does the figure of 35.8 million across the world and 14.1 million in India of slaves move you at all? If that does not help us to determne our life’s course then I don’t now what will!

The Bible says, "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; ensure justice for those being crushed. Yes, speak up for the poor and helpless, and see that they get justice" (Proverbs 31:8-9 NLT).

At Purnata we are committed to being that voice – a voice for the voiceless, for the poor, the sexually enslaved and the vulnerable. We're committed to bringing justice to their cause through our many advocacy and awareness events. So much of the world doesn't even know the horrible conditions and environments these children and families live in. If we at Purnata don't share their stories with people who actually have the ability to make a difference, we would be doing a crime.
