## Women's Day Special


On March 8th, 'Women' were celebrated worldwide.

At Purnata we celebrated the women we work with who have broken dreams, a sense of worthlessness and shunned by society.

We want to thank all who believed in the vision of Purnata and has believed in the love and strength of this community. We hope to provide better life for these survivors through your help.

Special thanks to Ketto.org and Humans of Bombay for reaching out and creating an opportunity to partner in building the many precious lives trapped in Mumbai's sex trade.

Click, read, watch, contribute, share and watch out for more updates in our newsletters, our website and on facebook page.
