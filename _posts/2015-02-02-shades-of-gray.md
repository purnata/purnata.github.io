##### Where Do We Draw The Line?

Movies are all about different interpretations of love. Sometimes, even action movies are not spared. It just seems like, everyone is looking for love. We see so many stories often of girls who fell in love with a stranger, pin all their hopes and dreams on them, elope to marry and then end up in a life of misery and broken dreams.

Recently the Hollywood movie, Fifty Shades of Grey, broke box office records on a weekend that is traditionally supposed to celebrate love. The film is an adaptation of E L James’ ridiculously popular book Fifty Shades of Grey. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson glamorizes the film as a "powerful and romantic love story." In reality, Fifty Shades of Grey is nothing short of a sickening story about a powerful and sadistic male perpetrator who preys on Anastasia Steele, a young, naïve, and college girl. What made moviegoers from around the world flock to theaters, spending over 260 million USD to see the film on its opening weekend? Perhaps the nudity? Or curiosity? The story romanticizes sadistic perpetrators and reinforces / perpetuates a cultural narrative that renders women as a subjugated class of sexual objects that men use and consume. Love and respect is replaced with abuse and narcissistic pleasure seeking. BDSM is mainstreamed and makes it look normal.

This movie undermines the thousands and millions of women and children who have had horrific experiences with sexual abuse. The stories the film industry shares through films shape our ideas and values. We must take a stand and tell the truth about the impact of sexually violent films on our culture.
